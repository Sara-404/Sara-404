## Hi, My name is Sara García 😊
I'm a **DAM** (Multiplatform Application Development) **student**, with just the FCT internship remaining.

I like programming in general, but what I like the most is **Mobile Development** 📱.

The programming languages that I control the most are Java, Kotlin and C#.

I use tools like **Android Studio**, **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**, **Visual Studio**, **Visual Studio Code**, **MySQL** and **SQL Developer**. I am familiar with the basics of **Git**  and **GitHub**.

My native language is Spanish. I also have advanced English skills, and know a little about French.

I am **currently** advancing and improving my knowledge in java through the "Píldoras Informáticas" Java course.

_Fun fact_: I am sound technician 🎚️, I play the piano 🎹 and have knowledge of music theory 🎵. I love learning new things.
